# Data-Analyst-Intern-at-Elevate-Labs-Task-8
In this task, I created a basic static dashboard to visualize the sales performance of an e-commerce dataset using Python. I began by importing and analyzing the Ecommerce_Product_Sales.csv dataset, converting the order dates into a "Month-Year" format for temporal analysis. Then I generated three key visualizations: a line chart to track monthly sales trends, a bar chart to display total revenue by region (represented by sellers), and a donut chart to show the distribution of sales across different product categories. From these visuals, I extracted actionable insights such as identifying peak sales months (February and December), top-performing sellers (Seller A), and leading product categories (Toys and Electronics). These static visuals effectively highlight key trends.
